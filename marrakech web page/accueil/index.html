          <h2>Understand</h2>
          <p>The name Marrakech originates from the Amazigh (Berber) words amur (n) kush, which means "Land of God." It is the third largest city in Morocco, after Casablanca and Fez, and lies near the foothills of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains. It is a few hours from the foot of the Sahara Desert. Its location and contrasting landscape has made it an enviable destination in Morocco. </p>

            <p>Marrakech-Menara Airport (IATA: RAK), ☎+212 4444 7910, +212 4444 78 65, +212 4444 8506. Marrakech has an international airport with direct scheduled flights from London, Dublin, Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Paris, Madrid, and many charter flights arriving from all over Europe. If you are flying from the US, Canada, Asia or elsewhere, you'll have to change planes in Casablanca.
              Plenty of low cost companies fly to Marrakech. Some companies fly to Casablanca, where a plane change for the 45 min flight to Marrakech can be made.
              From the UK, easyJet flies to Marrakech from Manchester, Bristol, London Stansted and Gatwick Airport (and also from Madrid and from Lyon). Ryanair has direct flights from Oporto (Portugal), Prague (Czechia), Luton, Dublin, and Stansted to Marrakech. They also fly from Frankfurt-Hahn (Germany), Alicante (Spain), Girona (Spain), Madrid, Reus (Spain), and Rome Ciampino (Italy) to Marrakech. Thomson Airways travels from London Gatwick and Manchester. British Airways began flying from London Gatwick in 2011 and now have a daily service to Marrakech.

            <h3>By bus</h3>
            <p>

              There are many long distance bus companies operating in Morocco which serve Marrakech and other cities.
              The recommended bus companies for tourists are CTM, Pullman du sud and Supratours. Other companies exist, though these three companies are usually your safest options. There is a Supratours office inside the main hall of the Marrakech railway station. CTM bus tickets can be bought upstairs in the Telephone place on Rue Bab Agnaou off the main square (look for a neon telephone on the top of the building) and an Eservice shop (look for a yellow sign) on an alleyway just off the same road, opposite Restaurant Omar.              
              Most ALSA (local destination bus company) and private bus lines arrive at the long distance bus station near Bab Doukkala, a 20-min walk (Dh 15-20 by petit taxi) from Djemaa El-Fna. Supratours and Eurolines buses operate from here. It's the place to take the buses from the small companies that go directly to small destinations.             
              The long distance bus station, CTM and private bus companies travel to destinations such as Agadir, Safi, Casablanca, El Jadida, Essaouira, Fez, Meknes, Ouarzazate, Rabat, and Taroudant. Taxi touts will often gather in the bus station to convince you that a bus to your destination is 'full', to steer you into a grand taxi, and to attempt to sell you goods as your taxi is prepared. This can be difficult if there is nobody manning the ticket desks, and the best option is to walk out of the station to the coaches -- a ticket can usually be purchased from a conductor on board.             
              If you would rather avoid the hassle of this then there is the option of booking a shuttle bus online. Souk to Surf runs shuttles from Marrakesh to Essaouira (150dh), Imlil (100dh), Taghazout (200dh), Tamraght (200dh) and Imsouane (250dh). These depart every day from various locations spread throughout central Marrakesh - in most cases you should be able to walk to one of the pick up points from your hotel. The shuttles are slightly more expensive than the local buses, but arguably the peace of mind of having a guaranteed seat makes up for this. The journey time from Marrakesh to the coast is between 3-4 hours (depending on the destination) and the shuttle will drop you directly in the centre of the town / village.              
              For trips to Meknes (6h, ~120 Dh) be advised that while seemingly shorter on the map, the mountain route via Beni Millal takes at least 2 hours more than on the highway via Rabat and Casa. Going there by train (6½h, 174 Dh) is the most comfortable option, although buses might be slightly quicker.              
              For those interested in overnight transit to Tangier, there is an overnight bus that leaves the main bus station at midnight every night (8h, 160 Dh). This is a great alternative for the overnight train to Tangier, as there's no need to transfer, the bus is almost nonstop (besides one or two breaks), and the journey is 2 hours shorter than the overnight train. Tickets can be purchased at the long-distance bus station (look for the ticket window operating buses to Rabat). CTM also operates overnight services to Tangier (9h, ~220 Dh).
              CTM operates a new bus station "Gare Voyageurs" one block south from the Supratour station next to the train station. It's better to take the buses there, because you can buy the tickets in advance. Besides, the CTM's offices there are better and there are no people trying to push you to their bus company. The office and station once on Zerktouni street do not exist anymore. CTM has an office at the long distance bus station (see above) if you just want to buy your tickets in advance or check the schedule. A taxi between the CTM bus station and the Medina should cost about 35dh.

        <h2>Get around<hr></h2>
        <p>Once in the medina, everything can be seen on foot, though you'll be doing a lot of walking. GPS is invaluable if you do not want to constantly rely on the help of locals to find your way. For exploring more of the city, buses and petits taxis are plentiful.
          There is a free travel guide and map application for Marrakech, called Marrakech Riad Travel Guide (you can look it up in the App Store), that can help you NOT to get completely lost in the medina. It uses GPS signal so there is also NO charge for using it and it also includes important places and some restaurants to visit.

          <h3>By bus</h3>
          <p>
            Almost all buses stop at Djemaa El-Fna and Place Youssef Ben Tachfine and fares range from Dh 2-5 depending on the distance. Important municipal bus lines are:
            <ul>
              <li>  No 1 - Towards Gueliz</li>
              <li>   Nos 3 and 8 - Stops at the central train station, and bus station (Gare Routiere Voyageurs Marrakech)</li>
              <li> No 10 - Stops at the long distance bus station</li>
              <li>No 11 - Will drop you off at the gardens of Menara</li>
              <li>  No 14 - Terminus Arset El Bilk at the central train station (4Dh)</li>
              <li>No 18 - Outside of Airport to Djemaa el-Fna.</li>
              <li>  No 19 - Airport express to Djemaa el-Fna (one way Dh30/return for Dh50)</li>
            </ul>
            Bus No 19 leaves Djemaa el-Fna every half an hour, starting at 6:15AM in the morning until 9:15PM. The trip to the airport takes about 25 minutes.
            If you exit the airport, walk towards the parking lot number three. They'll be a lot of cabs parked up. Follow the steps and keep walking forward till you see a sign for the bus and wait next to the hut marked as Police.            
            There is an open-topped City Sightseeing bus that will take you around the outskirts of the city, with commentary provided via headphones (supplied with your ticket) in 8 languages. The best place to catch it is from the coach stops by Square de Foucauld. Tickets cost Dh 168 each and are valid for 48 hours from the time of issue, no matter how many times you get on or off. However, check the timetable carefully: the buses can stop running earlier than you might think. The company has an app, but there are many reports of problems with it -including buying tickets. Simply buy your ticket on the bus and get the free map with all stops listed.

          <h3> By caleche</h3>
          <p>
           An alternative and romantic way to travel is by caleche -- pronounced kutchee -- a small horse-drawn carriage. They can be hired at Square de Foucauld (the small park at the bottom of Djemaa El-Fna). It's wise to agree on a price before setting off. As a guide price, you should pay around DH 150 per hour, per carriage.

              <h3>By taxi</h3>
              <p>
                

                If getting around by taxi, bear in mind that taxi drivers will make up many excuses to rip you off. For example:
                <ul>
                   <li> They don't have change.</li>
                   <li> They will hustle you to charge for everything such as bags. But you don't need to pay for extras. </li>
                   <li> For petit taxi, the maximum number of passengers is three (plus the driver). Sometimes you need to share with other passengers. If you are a group of two or three people, you just pay the one price and share with others (example, 10Dh for three passengers). </li>
                   <li> Generally during the daytime you will pay about 10dh; at night you should pay no more than 20dh.</li>
                   <li> The minimum charge is Dh7 before 8pm and after will be 10Dh.</li>
                   <li>  Dh 20 is a good price for a 10 min ride.</li>
                   <li>  For Grand Taxis (regular Mercedes taxis) there are no meters. Typically the set rate from Marrakech Airport to the Medina or Jemaa el Fna (Main square) is 150Dh. The maximum amount of passengers that can be carried by a Grande taxi is 6 - 4 passengers in the back seats and 2 passengers in the single front passenger side seat. Outside of the airport if you are a group of more than three (the maximum for a Petit Taxi), then negotiate your fee before you enter the Grand Taxi.</li>
               </ul>  
                Always ask to use the meter (compteur in French); otherwise, you are contributing to a culture of ripping off people. During the day you can generally get them to use the meter (if they refuse, just get out, stop another one). Your mileage may vary; in September 2017 one author (a white American with broken French) tried to get about 25 different taxis to use the meter over the course of his trip and could not persuade a single one.
                At night, tell them "ashreen" (20dh). If you go to nightlife locations, avoid the taxis that are waiting outside as these are thieves and they can extort you. It's best to get the telephone number of someone honest and ask them to pick you up               
                Other locations where the thieves wait is near Jemaa el Fna square and at tourist sites. Here it is best to stop a taxi that is passing in the street and not those that are waiting. Generally the older and more beat up the taxi and the older the driver, the better. The less they talk the better (no "where are you from, first time in Morocco, etc.").
